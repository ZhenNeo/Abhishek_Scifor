    "Tiger": "The Bengal Tiger is the national animal of both India and Bangladesh. The tigerâ€™s coat is yellow to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black. The number of tigers has reduced dramatically in the past few years, due to poaching and human-tiger conflict.",
    "Lion": "Asiatic Lion aka the Indian Lion or Persian Lion is a lion subspecies that is endangered. It differs from the African lion by less inflated auditory bullae, a larger tail tuft and a less developed mane.",
    "Blackbuck": "The Blackbuck is an ungulate species of antelope and it is near threatened. The main threat to this species is poaching, predation, habitat destruction, overgrazing, inbreeding and sanctuary visitors.",
    "Leopard": "The snow leopard is a large cat native to the mountain ranges in Central and South Asia. Snow leopards have long, thick fur, and their adaptations help them survive in harsh, cold environments. They are solitary animals and are known for their elusive nature, making them difficult to study in the wild."
